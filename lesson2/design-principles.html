            <p>When you look at the BYU Idaho canvas' website, it does not disturb our eyes because the boxes that contain
                the three buttons are aligned. Human's psychology tends to organize things which makes them comfortable to look at it.</p>

                such as the oval shape that fitting the pictures and the design of the paragraph that follows with it. The user loves something that
                are similars.
