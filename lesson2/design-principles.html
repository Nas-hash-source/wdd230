            <p>When you look at the BYU Idaho canvas' website, it does not disturb our eyes because the boxes that contain
                the three buttons are aligned. Human's psychology tends to organize things which makes them comfortable to look at it.</p>

            <p> For the openclassrooms' website, there are alignments as well but I would like to highlight the repetition of the patterns
                such as the oval shape that fitting the pictures and the design of the paragraph that follows with it. The user loves something that
                are similars.

            <img src="images/duolingo.jpg" alt="Screenshotof the Duolingo's website">
            <p>The screenshot above showed that Duolingo's website has used website has used
                white space very well. It looks clean, neat and professional. The user becomes
                hooked passively in the content because we do not need to make an effort to skim
                it. Instead, it pleases our eyes to read it.
